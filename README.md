Collection of workflows to use with Krita AI. They need to be open in Comfyui before applying to Krita

* Krita_loop.json  
This workflow allows repeating a certain step or steps. This has a potential in adding details without loosing the context.
The idea is to loop on specific steps instead of doing all the steps allover again, potentially having better loop results.
* Krita_loop plus.json  
I'm complicating things on this one. But, I am getting good results on some settings. Ask if interested.
  
  
* Krita Lora Info.json  
Shows the tags of the lora. Example <lora: ryu>  

* tooncrafter07b.json
Simple implimentation of tooncrafter. Choose two layers and generate to interpolate. You'll find the gif file in the temp file.
